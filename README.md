# YouTubePlaylistSanitizer

Tired of YouTube generating paylists with songs you've heard a thousand times?
This Tampermonkey script removes all videos you've already watched from the playlist.
(Should also work with Greasemonkey)

This script only removes videos in playlists generated by YouTube!

## How it works
The playlist is cleaned around 10 seconds after the page is loaded or the video changed.

Already played videos are detected by checking if the preview image of the video in 
the playlist has the red progress overlay in its thumbnail. It the progress bar is found,
the trash button is pressed.

The watch history of the current playlist is preserved. (Button won't be pressed for videos 
above the currently playing one). The very last video in the playlist is not removed as well, to always 
have at least one video to play next.
